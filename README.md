# Chat Code Interpreter

This is a Chat Code Interpreter application built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, the openai Python library, and Chainlit for the UI. It is designed to process user messages, including data analysis prompts and general chit-chat, and execute code.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repo_url>
    cd chat-code-interpreter
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
    *   Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t chat-code-interpreter .
    ```

4.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 chat-code-interpreter
    ```

5.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to use the application.
